Would ‘future contracts’ be chargeable to GST,"Future contracts are in the nature of financial derivatives, the price of which is dependent on the value of underlying stocks or index of stocks or certain approved currencies and the settlement happens normally by way of net settlement with no actual delivery. Since future contracts are in the nature of derivatives these qualify as ‘securities’ as defined in Section 2(101) of the CGST Act, 2017. As securities are neither ‘goods’ nor ‘services’ as defined in the CGST Act, 2017, future contracts are not chargeable to GST. But where the future contracts have a delivery option and the settlement of contract takes place by way of actual delivery of underlying commodity/currency, then such forward contracts would be treated as normal supply of goods and liable to GST.

Section 45U (d) of the RBI Act, 1934 defines ‘reverse repos’ as an instrument for lending funds by buying securities with an agreement to re-sell the securities on a mutually agreed future date at an agreed price which includes interest for the funds lent. Repos and reverse repos are financial instruments of short term call money market that are normally used by banks to borrow from or lend money to RBI. The margins, called the repo rate or reverse repo rate, in such transactions are nothing but interest charged for lending or borrowing of money.

To what extent is invoice discounting or cheque discounting or any other similar form of discounting exempt under GST?,"Discounting of invoices or cheques falls within the meaning of “services by way of extending deposits, loans or advances in so far as the consideration is represented by way of interest or discount”. Such discounting is exempt from payment of GST, as such discounting is nothing but a manner of extending a credit facility or a loan. However, if some service charges or service fees or documentation fees or broking charges or such like fees or charges are charged, the same would be a consideration for supply of service and chargeable to GST",services
Is interest on debt instruments exempt from GST,"Yes. As debt instruments such as debentures, bonds etc. are in the nature of loans, interest thereon will be exempt from GST",credits

The interest represents the time value of the money expended by the Bank in financing the asset. Services by way of extending deposits, loans or advances in so far as the consideration is represented by way of interest or discount (other than interest involved in credit card services) is exempt. But, in a financial lease the ownership of the asset is with the bank. In essence, it is a ‘purchase the asset and lend it further’ transaction for bank. Therefore, neither the services are purely in the nature of extending loans nor the consideration for a financial lease is purely in the nature of interest.

The proviso to section 34(2) of the CGST Act, 2017 provides that no reduction in liability would be allowed if the incidence of tax has been passed on to another person. If bad debts are on account of deficiency in supply of services, or tax charged being greater than actual tax liability, or goods returned, GST paid on the same is refundable subject to fulfilment of the prescribed conditions.

What is the location of the supplier in case of banking and other financial services where multiple locations are involved in providing the services to a customer,"Banking services emanate from the bank account opened by a customer with the branch of a bank or through a contractual relationship between the branch of a bank and the customer. The branch holding the customer’s account is referred to as the ‘Account Branch’ or the ‘Home Branch’. An account would include all types of accounts – viz. interest bearing, non- interest bearing, loan account, deposit account, etc. In the present day of “anywhere banking”, the customer avails banking services through mobile/ internet banking or by visiting any branch of the bank. At times the services are provided through branches / locations other than the ‘Account Branch’ or the ‘Home Branch’. It is clarified that the services provided by the other branches are actually services provided to the ‘Home branch’ and are ultimately billed to the home branch. Thus, the location of supplier in such cases is the Home Branch/Account Branch.",services
What is the manner of dealing with various services provided by banks and other financial institutions,"Banks and financial institutions provide a bouquet of financial services relating to lending or borrowing of money or investments in money and other related services. For such services invariably a variety of instruments are used in the financial markets. Transactions in such instruments have to be examined on the touchstone of definition of ‘supply’ given in Section 7(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 to see whether such transactions would be chargeable to GST. Broadly, the following legal provisions would have a bearing on determining the taxability of such transactions. The definition of ‘goods’ and ‘services’ in Section 2(52) and Section 2(102) of the CGST Act, 2017 specifically excludes money and securities respectively. ‘Money’ has been defined in Section 2(75) of the CGST Act, 2017 to include instruments like cheques, drafts, pay orders, promissory notes, letters of credit, etc. Therefore, activities that are only transactions in such instruments would be outside the definition of service. This would include transactions in Commercial Paper (‘CP’) and Certificate of Deposit (‘CD’) (as they are in the nature of promissory notes), issuance of drafts or letters of credit, etc. While these transactions would be outside the ambit of supply, the related activity, for which a separate consideration is charged, would be chargeable to GST if other elements of taxability are present. Therefore, GST would be levied on service charges normally charged for various transactions in money including charges for making drafts, issuance charges for letter of credit etc. Definition of ‘securities’ includes ‘derivatives’. Transactions in instruments like interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange swaps would be excluded from the definition of ‘supply’ since such instruments are derivatives, being securities, based on contracts of difference. However, any attendant service charges or fees would be chargeable to GST. Further, services by way of extending deposits, loans or advances in so far as the consideration is represented by way of interest or discount is exempt from the levy of GST",services

The Banks deliver gold (metal) to the jewellers who appropriate and use the same in the course of their business. The gold (metal) is seldom returned and the jeweller fixes the price of gold (metal) within the stipulated period of 180 to 270 days. Considering the nature of transaction, the supply of gold (metal) will take place on the date of delivery of gold (metal) to the jeweller. The Banks should raise the invoice at the time of delivery of gold (metal) in terms of section 12 of the CGST Act, 2017. Since the price of gold (metal) is not fixed, banks may issue an invoice wherein the value of the supply may be indicated on the basis of the metal rate in the international or domestic market. As and when the price is finally fixed by the jeweller, the Bank should issue debit or credit notes for the difference in the price as per the original invoice and the price finally fixed, along with applicable GST",credits
Whether tax is payable on interest charged by the Banks on the outstanding amount of gold (metal) loan,"The Gold (Metal) Loan Scheme is a means of financing. The jewellers can purchase gold (metal) from the Banks on outright basis on payment of the price. The gold (metal) loan only provides an option to the jeweller to avail a loan and pay for gold (metal) at a future date. For this facility, the jeweller pays interest to the Bank. The grant of loan and levy of interest is dependent on the purchase of gold, and therefore, part of the same transaction or facility; therefore the interest, which is the consideration, will not be exempt as per provisions of section 15(2)(d) of the CGST Act, 2017",credits

In general, this will be the State in which the account exists. For example, if the account is held in Delhi, and some services are obtained by the account holder in Maharashtra, the place of supply of services will be Delhi (and hence Central tax / State tax or Union territory tax will be chargeable). In such transactions, the branch in Maharashtra will only be a facilitator for providing these services. If the branch in Maharashtra levies any charges on the branch in Delhi for providing this facility, that will be a separate supply between the two branches, it will be chargeable to Integrated tax",services
